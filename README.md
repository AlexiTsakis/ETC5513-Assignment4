The seatbelts dataset is inbuilt in R, and there is no randomness in the functions used, so the results should be reproducible from running the rmd.

This project uses the seatbelts dataset in R, a dataset on car related deaths and car statistics from 1968 to 1984, to investigate the following

- 1) Did seatbelts have a notable effect on number of deaths?
- 2) Is there any relationship between driver deaths and the other variables in this dataset?
- 3) What is the trend and trough of driver deaths?
- 4) Is there any seasonality to number of deaths?
